# Corner-Grocer-Item-Tracking-Program
The Corner Grocer Item-Tracking Program was created to help a small grocery store quickly track how often different items are purchased. Instead of counting by hand, the program reads a text file of items and automatically calculates how many times each one appears. It then displays the results in both a list and a simple histogram, giving a clear view of which products are most popular. I’m proud of how organized and easy to follow my code turned out. I made sure to use clear comments, readable variable names, and logical functions so anyone could understand or update the program later on.

The biggest challenge I faced was making sure the program counted items correctly, especially when the input file included extra spaces or different capitalizations. I solved that by cleaning up the data before processing it and testing multiple files to make sure everything worked properly. If I were to improve the project, I’d add a feature to export reports to a file or maybe create a simple interface to make it more interactive. This project really helped me strengthen my understanding of file input and output, loops, and data structures in C++, and I know these skills will be useful in my future courses and software projects.
